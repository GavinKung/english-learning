# Cultural Heritage Tourism: Finding the Balance  

---

## 1. The Tightrope Walk: Preservation vs. Profit  
Tourism brings both opportunities and challenges to historical sites:  

**Successful Model**  
- Kyoto's **Gion District** (/ɡiːˈoʊn/): Maintains traditional tea houses by limiting tacky souvenir shops  
- **Machiya townhouses** (/ˈmɑːtʃiːjɑː/) preserved through strict zoning laws  

**Warning Example**  
- China's **Lijiang Old Town**: Lost authentic charm when local families were replaced by noisy bars  
- Key issue: **over-commercialization** (/ˌoʊvərkəˌmɜːrʃələˈzeɪʃən/)  

| Do's ✅                  | Don'ts ❌                 |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
| Controlled visitor flow  | Overcrowding chaos       |  
| Local artisan crafts     | Mass-produced trinkets   |

## 2. Luoyang Case: When History Meets Hype  
### A. The Good, The Bad & The Ugly  
**Positive Experience**  
- **Longmen Grottoes** (/ˈɡrɒtəʊz/):  
  - 1,500-year-old Buddha statues radiating **historical gravitas** (/ɡrəˈvɑːtəs/)  
  - AR tech shows stolen fragments (like **Vairocana Buddha**'s hands)  

**Frustrations**  
- **Hanfu photo frenzy**: Historic streets turned into Instagram studios  
  - Example: "Every cobblestone had 5 photographers elbowing for space!"  
- **Transport meltdowns**: 2-hour queues for buses in scorching heat  

### B. Deeper Wounds  
- Broken statues: 30% damaged by wars & theft  
- **Looted artifacts** (/ˈluːtɪd ˈɑːrtɪfækts/) in Western museums like the British Museum

## 3. Global Perspectives  
### Western Museums' Dirty Secret?  
- **British Museum** holds 23,000 Chinese artifacts - many stolen during colonial era  
- 62% Europeans support **repatriation** (/ˌrɛpətriˈeɪʃən/) (2023 Pew Research)  

### Japan's Unique Approach  
- **Ise Shrine**: Rebuilt every 20 years since 690 AD  
- Focus: **Spiritual continuity** > physical preservation

## 4. Let's Discuss!  
### Questions for Your Teacher  
1. "Have you experienced **cultural dissonance** (/ˈdɪsənəns/) at over-touristed sites?"  
2. "Should museums return looted art even if origin countries lack preservation tech?"  

### Sentence Templates  
- *"The ________ scene where ________ perfectly captures ________."*  
  Example: "The hanfu photo scene where influencers posed on ancient walls captured commercialization gone wild."
