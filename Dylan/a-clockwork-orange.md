---

## Part 1: Detailed Plot Breakdown (18 mins)  
### **Alex's Journey Through Ultra-Violence**  
**Chapter 1: The Savage Nights**  
- **The Korova Milk Bar Ritual**:  
  Alex and his "droogs" (/druːɡz/) drink **moloko plus** - milk laced with drugs that "sharpen you up for a bit of the old ultra-violence."  
  *Key detail*: The bar's furniture is naked mannequins with glass tables - disturbing art foreshadowing cruelty.  

- **The Writer's Home Invasion**:  
  Alex sings *Singin' in the Rain* while beating writer Mr. Alexander and raping his wife.  
  *Why it matters*: This song becomes his psychological trigger later.  

**Chapter 2: Betrayal & Imprisonment**  
- **The Cat Lady Murder**:  
  Alex kills her with a giant ceramic penis statue during a robbery.  
  *Irony*: His droogs betray him by smashing a milk bottle on his face - "That's for what you did to us, you bastard!"  

- **Prison Experiments**:  
  Alex volunteers for the **Ludovico Technique** to shorten his sentence.

## Part 5: Deeper Connections & Modern Relevance (20 mins)

### **Topic 1: The Burgess Connection - The Missing Final Chapter**

**Background**:
Anthony Burgess's novel had a final chapter that Kubrick **omitted** (/əˈmɪtɪd/ - 省略，删去) from his film (it was also missing from the American edition of the book until 1986). In this chapter, Alex grows older, tires of violence, and **contemplates** (/ˈkɒntəmpleɪts/ - 思忖，考虑) starting a family. He sees another youth acting as he once did and feels a sense of pity and maturity. He chooses to **renounce** (/rɪˈnaʊns/ - 宣布放弃) violence, not through conditioning, but through genuine personal growth.

**Key Vocabulary**:
| Word/Phrase | Meaning | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|
| **Redemption** | The act of being saved from sin, error, or evil. (救赎) | /rɪˈdɛmpʃən/ |
| **Ambiguous** | Open to more than one interpretation; not having one obvious meaning. (模棱两可的) | /æmˈbɪɡjuəs/ |
| **Authorial Intent** | The meaning or interpretation of a work that the author had in mind. (作者意图) | /ɔːˈθɔːriəl ɪnˈtɛnt/ |
| **Pessimistic** | Tending to see the worst aspect of things. (悲观的) | /ˌpɛsɪˈmɪstɪk/ |

**Discussion Prompts**:
1.  Why do you think Kubrick chose to end the film on a more **pessimistic** and **ambiguous** note, with Alex smirking, "I was cured, alright!"?
2.  Does the inclusion of the original final chapter change the entire message of the story? How so? Does it make the story better or worse, in your opinion?
3.  Which ending do you find more powerful or thought-provoking: the film's cynical end or the novel's hopeful one? Discuss the concept of **redemption**.

### **Topic 2: Kubrick's Thematic Universe - Man vs. System**

**Background**:
A recurring theme in Kubrick's films is the struggle of the individual against a vast, **dehumanizing** (/diːˈhjuːmənaɪzɪŋ/ - 使丧失人类的), and often **incomprehensible** (/ˌɪnkɒmprɪˈhɛnsəbl/ - 难以理解的) system. We see this in *A Clockwork Orange* (Alex vs. the Government), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (Dave Bowman vs. HAL 9000), and *Dr. Strangelove* (everyone vs. nuclear annihilation protocol).

**Key Vocabulary**:
| Word/Phrase | Meaning | Pronunciation |
|---|---|---|
| **Futile** | Incapable of producing any useful result; pointless. (徒劳的) | /ˈfjuːtaɪl/ |
| **Bureaucracy** | A system of government with complex rules and procedures. (官僚体制) | /bjʊəˈrɒkrəsi/ |
| **Autonomy** | The right or condition of self-government; freedom from external control. (自主权) | /ɔːˈtɒnəmi/ |

**Discussion Prompts**:
1.  Compare Alex's struggle for **autonomy** with Dave's fight against HAL 9000 in *2001*. Are they both fighting a form of **bureaucracy** or system that has gone wrong?
2.  Is the struggle against the system always **futile** in Kubrick's films? Does anyone ever truly "win"?
3.  How does the visual style of *A Clockwork Orange* (the symmetrical shots, the sterile environments) contribute to this feeling of a **dehumanizing** system?

## Part 6: Wrap-up & Freestyle Conversation (5-10 mins)
