# *The Graduate*: The Sound of Silence and Suburban Disillusionment

---

## Part 1: "Plastics" and Other Anxieties (10 mins)

**Synopsis**:
Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college graduate and track star, returns to his wealthy parents' home in Southern California. Despite his academic achievements, he is filled with anxiety and **alienation** (/ˌeɪliəˈneɪʃn/ - 疏离感) about his future. At his graduation party, he is cornered by his parents' friends, who offer him vapid advice, famously summarized in one word: "Plastics." Feeling lost, he is seduced by the older, sophisticated, and married Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner. Their aimless affair begins, setting the stage for a crisis of identity and rebellion.

**Initial Reaction & Key Concepts**:
*   **The Generation Gap**: The film perfectly captures the profound cultural divide of the 1960s between the optimistic, materialistic post-war generation and their disillusioned, questioning children.
*   **Satire** (/ˈsætaɪər/ - 讽刺): Director Mike Nichols uses sharp humor and irony to critique the superficiality, hypocrisy, and emptiness of the suburban upper-middle-class lifestyle.
*   **Visual Metaphors**: The film is rich with symbolism. Benjamin is often shown trapped by doorways, reflected in glass, or submerged in water, visually representing his feelings of confinement and emotional drowning.

**Discussion Starter**:
*   "The film opens with Benjamin on a moving walkway at the airport, with Simon & Garfunkel's 'The Sound of Silence' playing. What does this opening sequence immediately tell us about his character and the film's tone?"

## Part 2: "Mrs. Robinson, You're Trying to Seduce Me" (20 mins)

### **Scene Analysis: The Seduction**
**What Happens**: Mrs. Robinson orchestrates a situation to be alone with Benjamin, asking him to drive her home and then insisting he come inside. Her seduction is both awkward and **predatory** (/ˈprɛdətəri/ - 掠夺性的). She is in complete control, while Benjamin is passive and flustered.

**Cinematic Technique - Framing & Power Dynamics**:
*   Mike Nichols masterfully uses framing to show who has the power. The most iconic shot has Mrs. Robinson's leg in the foreground, perfectly framing a small, helpless-looking Benjamin in the background. This isn't just a cool shot; it visually tells the entire story of their dynamic: he is trapped in her design.

**Character Deep Dive: Mrs. Robinson**
*   She is more than just a one-dimensional villain. She is a tragic figure, a woman whose own dreams were crushed. She reveals she had to drop out of art school to marry Mr. Robinson after getting pregnant. Her bitterness and alcoholism stem from a deep-seated **disillusionment** (/ˌdɪsɪˈluːʒənmənt/ - 幻灭). Her affair with Benjamin is an act of rebellion against her own empty life.

### **The Shift: The Pursuit of Elaine**
**What Happens**: The one rule of the affair is that Benjamin is forbidden from dating Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross). Naturally, his parents push him to do exactly that. He initially tries to sabotage the date but finds himself genuinely drawn to Elaine's innocence. When Mrs. Robinson reveals the affair to Elaine, Benjamin's aimlessness transforms into a frantic, desperate obsession to win Elaine back.

**Discussion**:
*   "Is Mrs. Robinson a sympathetic character? Why is she so vehemently opposed to Benjamin seeing Elaine? Is it jealousy, or a twisted form of protection?"
*   "Is Benjamin's love for Elaine real, or is she just a symbol of the purity and meaning his life lacks? Is his pursuit of her just another form of rebellion?"

## Part 3: The Frantic Escape to... Where? (10 mins)

**The Climax: Crashing the Wedding**
*   The final act is a frantic race against time, as Benjamin drives his car until it runs out of gas and then runs on foot to stop Elaine's wedding. He bangs on the church's glass window, screaming her name. This is the moment he finally takes decisive, albeit chaotic, action.
*   The escape itself is iconic. He uses a large cross to bar the church doors, trapping the wedding guests—the very society they are fleeing from.

**The Final Scene: The Bus Ride to Nowhere**
*   Benjamin and Elaine, still in her wedding dress, get on a public bus. They are laughing, high on the adrenaline of their escape. But as the camera holds on them, their smiles slowly fade. They look at each other, then forward, their expressions turning to anxiety and uncertainty. The **euphoria** (/juːˈfɔːriə/ - 狂喜) is gone, replaced by the terrifying question: "What now?"

**Key Questions for Debate**:
1.  **The Illusion of Freedom**: The ending is famously **ambiguous** (/æmˈbɪɡjuəs/ - 模棱两可的). Did they truly escape, or have they just traded one form of entrapment for another? What does the film say about the nature of rebellion?
2.  **The Sound of Silence**: Simon & Garfunkel's music isn't just background noise; it's the film's soul. How do songs like "The Sound of Silence" and "Scarborough Fair" amplify the themes of miscommunication and youthful melancholy?

## Part 4: The Sound of Silence (5 mins)

**Objective**:
Use the vocabulary and concepts from today's lesson to discuss the film's lasting impact and its relevance today.

**Example Starters**:
*   "The film's **ambiguous** ending is what makes it a masterpiece. It suggests that the act of rebellion is easier than the reality of what comes after..."
*   "For me, the central theme isn't love, but **alienation**. Benjamin is just as alienated at the end of the film as he was at the beginning, but now he has company."
*   "The critique of suburban **materialism** is still incredibly relevant. The 'Plastics' scene has become a cultural shorthand for selling out."
