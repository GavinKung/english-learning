#### **Plot Summary**  
Set in 1970s post-Vietnam New York City, *Taxi Driver* follows **Travis Bickle** (Robert De Niro), a lonely, mentally unstable taxi driver suffering from **chronic insomnia** (/ˈkrɑːnɪk ɪnˈsɔːmniə/). Disgusted by the city’s **moral decay**—prostitution, crime, and political hypocrisy—Travis oscillates between delusional fantasies of becoming a **vigilante** (/ˈvɪdʒɪlənt/) hero and self-destructive behavior. His failed attempt to connect with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer he idealizes, accelerates his spiral into violence, culminating in a bloody **climax** where he "rescues" Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12-year-old prostitute, through brutal means. The film ends ambiguously, with Travis hailed as a hero despite his obvious **psychosis** (/saɪˈkoʊsɪs/).

#### **Detailed Scene Analysis**  

##### **1. The "You Talkin’ to Me?" Mirror Scene**  
**Context**: Travis practices confronting imaginary enemies in his apartment mirror.  

**Visual Techniques**:  
- **Low-angle shots** (/loʊ ˈæŋɡl ʃɑːts/): The camera tilts upward, making Travis appear larger and more threatening, reflecting his inflated self-image.  
- **Monochromatic lighting** (/ˌmɑːnoʊkrəˈmætɪk/): The reddish-brown tones create a hellish atmosphere, symbolizing his **internal rage**.  
- **Tight framing**: The cluttered apartment walls visually "trap" Travis, mirroring his mental isolation.  

**Symbolic Dialogue**:  
*"You talkin’ to me? … I’m the only one here."*  
- The stammering repetition reveals his **fragile masculinity** and desperate need for validation.  
- The mirror, a classic symbol of **self-deception**, shows Travis crafting a violent persona to escape his powerlessness.  

**Discussion Questions**:  
- *"Why do you think Scorsese chose a mirror instead of another object (e.g., a weapon) for this scene?"*  
- *"How does the lighting color shift from blue (calm) to red (danger) during his monologue?"*

##### **2. The Bloody Climax: "Rescuing" Iris**  
**Context**: Travis storms a brothel to "save" Iris, murdering her pimp and clients.  

**Contrast Techniques**:  
- **Slow-motion** vs. **chaotic editing**: The initial slow-motion close-up of Travis’s boots builds tension, while rapid cuts mimic his fractured mental state.  
- **Diegetic sound** (/ˌdaɪəˈdʒɛtɪk/): The eerie silence after the massacre highlights the **moral emptiness** of his actions.  

**Moral Ambiguity**:  
Grotesque close-ups of blood-soaked walls force viewers to question: Is this **redemption** (/ˌrɛdəmˈpʃən/) or **psychotic breakdown**?  

**Vocabulary Builder**:  
| Basic Term       | Advanced Replacement      |  
|-------------------|---------------------------|  
| "crazy"          | **psychotic breakdown**   |  
| "sad ending"     | **morally ambiguous climax** |  
| "main character" | **antihero protagonist**  |

##### **3. The Final Scene: False Heroism**  
**Context**: Newspapers hail Travis as a hero.  

**Visual Irony**:  
- **High-key lighting**: Bright tones expose society’s willingness to glorify violence for a comforting **narrative** (/ˈnærətɪv/).  
- **Breaking the fourth wall**: Travis’s menacing glance warns against complacency.  

**Discussion Prompt**:  
*"Scorsese said, ‘Travis is both the villain and the mirror of our society.’ Do you agree? How does the final scene support this?"*
